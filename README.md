How the application was develop
-------------------------------
For a single page aplication application template I used React.js framemwork.
Official instructions on how this is done can be found here:
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app

As this was my first time ever exposure to utilizing React.js,
I also spent some time going over this tutorial
https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/

Once I got a handle on the workings of React.js I started implementing the application.
I used the information in the mock take home document / screen shoot as direction for UI layout.
I had not prior experience with any of the Frameworks mentioned in the document.
My experience with front end was limmited to just HTML/ CSS and pure Javascript.
React.js was my choice of Framework as I believe it the most popular; and it was the one I wanted to learn.

Although it was not mentioned in the specs, It seems obvious to me that duplicates and empty records should
not ne allowed; so I implemented the app to reject those. I also went ahead and implemented record delete / removal.

Edit a record
-------------
I add a button for this functionality but left the implemnetation for further dicussion.
The most obvious implement for me would be to do a pop-up form with the record fields filled in.
This would be a user friendly way to allow user to update fields with current value as reference.

Comments on take home
---------------------
Challenging to me as i had no previous experiemce with a front-end framework.
A good learming experience for me; and I think it a fair challenge  for Sr role.
I sure it will be trival for a more experience front-end engineer.

Happy Hacking :-)
